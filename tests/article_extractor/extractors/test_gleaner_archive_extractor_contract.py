"""External service contract test for GleanerArchiveExtractor.

This test validates that the Gleaner newspaper archive website structure hasn't changed
in ways that would break our extractor. It makes a live HTTP request to verify
the current archive site structure matches our implementation expectations.

        Verify Gleaner archive site structure works with extractor.

        This test detects breaking changes to the gleaner.newspaperarchive.com website
        by validating that our extractor can successfully parse a known live archive page.

        The test validates:
        - Extractor successfully extracts OCR content from live archive page
        - Title extraction works (via LLM or fallback to og:title)
        - Author extraction works (via LLM from OCR text)
        - Date extraction works (from URL pattern)
        - Full text extraction works (from OCR sections)

        Note: This test makes real LLM API calls and requires OPENAI_API_KEY.
